    <p>Absolute Positions: It is the property of css used to place the items precisely where you want it. Absolute positioning is done relative to the first relatively (or absolutely) positioned parent element. 
        In this case when there is no positioned parent element present, the element that has position set to absolute will be positioned related directly to the HTML element (the page itself).</p>

    <p>In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
        It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. <br>
        Explanation of the different parts: <br>
        Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear <br>
        Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent <br>
        Border - A border that goes around the padding and content <br>
        Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent <br>
        The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.</p>
